It views disability as a direct consequence of a \u2018deviation\u2019 from what is considered a \u2018normal\u2019 physical or mental state of the body. In this framework, the primary aim is to \u2018correct\u2019, \u2018cure\u2019, or \u2018prevent\u2019 this deviation, often through medical intervention.</p> <p>For instance, consider Ramesh, who experiences partial hearing disability. From a Medical Model perspective, this would be seen as a deviation from \u2018normal\u2019 hearing.

The goal is to enhance medical professionals\u2019 capacity to diagnose, cure, or manage disabilities.

This can mean that while Ramesh can describe the symptoms he experiences, the focus remains on the biological malfunction rather than his lived experience or interaction with his environment.</p>","tags":["Accessibility","DisabilityRights","MedicalModel","DisabilityAwareness","Inclusion","DigitalAccessibility","DisabilityStudies","SocialModelOfDisability","PuneetKala","KarmaSession","Dharma","TechForGood"]},{"location":"blog/medical-model.html#critiques-of-the-medical-model","title":"Critiques of the Medical Model\u00a0\ud83d\udcac","text":"<p>The Medical Model faces significant criticism, primarily because the language and concepts it employs can inadvertently perpetuate negative labels and stigma. Terms like \u201cdeviation\u201d can lead to people with disabilities being viewed as inherently \u201cdifferent\u201d or \u201cabnormal\u201d. This perspective can foster a sense of \u2018otherness\u2019 rather than inclusion.</p> <p>A key critique is the Medical Model\u2019s tendency to overlook or minimize the impact of social and environmental barriers on the experience of disability. Let\u2019s consider Rohan, if Rohan is trying to converse in a bustling construction zone, their ability to hear might be severly impacted. This scenario highlights an environmental barrier, not an inherent \u2018disability\u2019 in Rohan. The environment is creating the impediments.</p> <p>Similarly, think about Steve, a wheel chair user. If a building lacks a ramp or an elevator, Steve\u2019s ability to access an upper floor is hindered. In this instance, it\u2019s not Steve\u2019s wheelchair use that is the problem, but the inaccessible environment.

If a particular condition is rare, and dedicated medical research can lead to a cure or management strategy, this benefits not just the individual, but potentially many others facing similar challenges globally.

By focusing primarily on individual impairment, it often overlooks the profound influence of societal structures, attitudes, and physical environments.
