  			<p>The idea is about using the same screen anywhere. Be it a PC, mobile, tablet, glass, wall, literally anywhere, including it even getting functionality to perform activities on it. So, what we will be doing is we will be carrying a small device which we can connect to a PC, a Phone, and which can also display things on wall, glass, etc. This device can be as small as a size of pen drive. The idea of connecting the device to mobile and PC was suggested by Nipun Kanade, my ideas was just about displaying it on wall / glass anywhere you want.</p>
