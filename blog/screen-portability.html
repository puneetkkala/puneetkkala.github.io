			<h1>Screen Portability</h1>
  			<p>The idea is about using the same screen anywhere. Be it a PC, mobile, tablet, glass, wall, literally anywhere, including it even getting functionality to perform activities on it. So, what we will be doing is we will be carrying a small device which we can connect to a PC, a Phone, and which can also display things on wall, glass, etc. This device can be as small as a size of pen drive. The idea of connecting the device to mobile and PC was suggested by Nipun Kanade, my ideas was just about displaying it on wall / glass anywhere you want.</p>
  			<p>Note: As I mentioned, this idea is open to be used by anyone or if you wish to help me in researching about it, you can. I will keep updating the post whenever I get something related to it, if you suggest something, I will add your name to the post, or if you do not want me to share your name or suggestion, I will not do that.</p></p>
