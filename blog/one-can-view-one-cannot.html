  		<p>Two people are seeing the same screen, there are some confidential files, one can see those files, one cannot. I am trying to think of many ways to implement it. This involves identifying the people in front of you. For which ratina scan or face recognition can be done. I am not worried about identifying the person. I am worried about how can I hide the stuff. There are many technologies to identify people.</p>
  		<p>This is something which can be related to producing an image directly in personâ€™s ratina or may be has something to do with brain, neural networks. I am no genius, so still researching on it.</p>
