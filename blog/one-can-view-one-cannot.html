		<h1>One Can View, One Cannot</h1>
  		<p>Two people are seeing the same screen, there are some confidential files, one can see those files, one cannot. I am trying to think of many ways to implement it. This involves identifying the people in front of you. For which ratina scan or face recognition can be done. I am not worried about identifying the person. I am worried about how can I hide the stuff. There are many technologies to identify people.</p>
  		<p>This is something which can be related to producing an image directly in personâ€™s ratina or may be has something to do with brain, neural networks. I am no genius, so still researching on it.</p>
  		<p>Note: As I mentioned, this idea is open to be used by anyone or if you wish to help me in researching about it, you can. I will keep updating the post whenever I get something related to it, if you suggest something, I will add your name to the post, or if you do not want me to share your name or suggestion, I will not do that.</p>
