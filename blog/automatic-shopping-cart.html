				<p>This idea is about improving the shopping experience of people who visit shopping mall. This idea will help in faster and more comfortable shopping experience.</p>
  			<p>I am thinking of making a cart that can carry a human. The human will sit on the cart at the entrance of the shopping mall, he then will press a button for a thing which he needs to buy, the cart will take him there. For example, if he has to buy a soap, he will press soap, and the cart will take him to the soap counter. After he has done all his shopping, he just will need to press exit and the shopping cart will take him to billing counter and then outside the shopping mall. So, customer here had to nothing, he just had to click a few buttons to shop things.</p>
  			<p>The challenge here is managing the traffic, certainly there are going to be multiple carts in the shopping mall, there needs to be a super good algorithm to manage the same.</p>
