  			<p>This is something I am currently working on. This idea is about creating a background application which will log your activities to check your mood.</p>
  			<p>An example can be, you generally type quickly when you are angry.</p>
  			<p>I was able to figure out around 35 factors which modify mood of person. I am going to use the same factors to motivate a person.</p>
  			<p>The benefits of this app is that people will be able to motivate themselves, which will reduce the stress level of people, decrease the chances of depression etc.</p>
  			<p>It will be good for big companies too as their employees will be working more as due to the good motivation level.</p>
