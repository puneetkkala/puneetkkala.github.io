		<ul>
			<li>A friend is one who has the same enemies as you have.</li>
			<li>Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.</li>
			<li>Books serve to show a man that those original thoughts of his aren't very new at all.</li>
			<li>Character is like a tree and reputation like a shadow. This shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing.</li>
