  			<p>A friend is one who has the same enemies as you have.</p>
  			<p>Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.</p>
  			<p>Books serve to show a man that those original thoughts of his aren't very new at all.</p>
  			<p>Character is like a tree and reputation like a shadow. This shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing.</p>
