		<p class="light-gray-color small-intro-para">I am not a textile guy, so I am not aware whether this is implemented or not. The idea is about generation of new threads in a cloth so that size of cloth can increase when you get bigger. I have thought of this from human cell generation i.e. you get extra skin when you get bigger.</p>
