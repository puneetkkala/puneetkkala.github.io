# The Medical Model of Disability: An Overview 🩺

Today, let’s explore one of the fundamental frameworks for understanding disability: the Medical Model. This model offers a specific lens through which society has historically viewed and addressed disability.
## What is medical model? 🧑‍⚕️

**The Medical Model of Disability** posits that disability is primarily an individual problem. It views disability as a direct consequence of a ‘deviation’ from what is considered a ‘normal’ physical or mental state of the body. In this framework, the primary aim is to ‘correct’, ‘cure’, or ‘prevent’ this deviation, often through medical intervention.

For instance, consider Ramesh, who experiences partial hearing disability. From a Medical Model perspective, this would be seen as a deviation from ‘normal’ hearing. The proposed solution would involve focusing on Ramesh’s body — perhaps suggesting hearing aids, or other medical treatments to ‘fix’ the hearing impairment.

## Focus on Healthcare & the Medical Professional 🏥

Under the medical model, significant resources are typically allocated to the healthcare systems. The goal is to enhance medical professionals’ capacity to diagnose, cure, or manage disabilities. The medical professional stands as the central authority in this model.

Individuals with disabilities are often expected to articulate their symptoms to these professionals, who then perform a diagnosis based on perceived ‘abnormalities’ in biological or physiological terms. This can mean that while Ramesh can describe the symptoms he experiences, the focus remains on the biological malfunction rather than his lived experience or interaction with his environment.

## Critiques of the Medical Model 💬

The Medical Model faces significant criticism, primarily because the language and concepts it employs can inadvertently perpetuate negative labels and stigma. Terms like “deviation” can lead to people with disabilities being viewed as inherently “different” or “abnormal”. This perspective can foster a sense of ‘otherness’ rather than inclusion.

A key critique is the Medical Model’s tendency to overlook or minimize the impact of social and environmental barriers on the experience of disability. Let’s consider Rohan, if Rohan is trying to converse in a bustling construction zone, their ability to hear might be severly impacted. This scenario highlights an environmental barrier, not an inherent ‘disability’ in Rohan. The environment is creating the impediments.

Similarly, think about Steve, a wheel chair user. If a building lacks a ramp or an elevator, Steve’s ability to access an upper floor is hindered. In this instance, it’s not Steve’s wheelchair use that is the problem, but the inaccessible environment. The environment, by its design, created the disabling experience.

## Potential Benefits & Nuance 🤔

While facing criticism, approaching a problem from medical perspective can also offer advantages. For example, if a straightforward and effective medical intervention is available for Ramesh’s partial hearing, and this intervention can significantly improve his daily life and integration, then pursuing such a ‘fix’ is not inherently problematic.

Furthermore, medical research driven by this model can lead to significant breakthroughs. If a particular condition is rare, and dedicated medical research can lead to a cure or management strategy, this benefits not just the individual, but potentially many others facing similar challenges globally. As Leonardo da Vinci said, “Learning never exhausts mind.”🌱 This quest for knowledge can pave the way for the medical advancements that enhances lives.

## A Partial Picture 🖼️

Ultimately, the Medical Model of Disability cannot be universally classified as ‘right’ or ‘wrong’. However, it is crucial to recognize that it presents only a partial view of the complex experience of disability. By focusing primarily on individual impairment, it often overlooks the profound influence of societal structures, attitudes, and physical environments. Therefore, while offering some benefits, it can lead to a biased understanding, limiting the scope of solutions to solely medical interventions rather than broader societal changes. As Lord Mahavir taught, “Truth is vast and has many aspects.” We must strive to see the full picture.
