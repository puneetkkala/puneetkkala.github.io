# What is Accessibility?
Accessibility is quality of being able to be reached or defined. Accessibility means that everyone can use or access something easily, regardless of physical or other limitations they may have. Internationally, rights of people with disabilities is protected by United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).
## What is Disability?
UNCRPD defines disability as long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. Disability can be cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, sensory, or a combination of multiple factors. It can be present from birth or can be acquired later. It can be situational, temporary, or permanent.
## Languages used for disability
There are three types of languages which are used for people with disabilities:

1. People-first language
2. Identify-first language
3. People-centered language

### People-first language
People-first language considers person before disability. The person who prefers people-first language would be called `a person with a disability`. This style is referred in legislations like Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and UNCRPD. The reason given in support of people-first language is that people with disabilities are humans first. This will prevent people from preforming a mental image of the person who is being referred. This will prevent marginalization of discrimination against people.
### Identity-first language
People-first language consider disability before person. The person who prefers identity-first language would be called `a disabled person`. The reason given in support of identity-first language is person is not disabled by their body, but by the environment. It is also same as how other aspects of diversity and identity are talked about. There are many organisations who prefer identity-first language too.
### People-centered language
People-centered language consider asking the person who is being referred to. The reason given in support of people-centered language is that it should be upto people how they want to be referred to. If a person prefers to be called as `a blind person` they should be called `a blind person` and not `a person who is blind` or vice-versa.
