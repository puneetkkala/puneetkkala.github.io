# Puneet Kala
I am a software engineer passionate about Android development, accessibility, machine learning, security, and sustainability. I want to use technology to benefit people, society, and the planet.

During my BE, I was introduced to Android, machine learning, and cybersecurity. In 2015, I and one of my friends were curious about how people with vision disability use an app. We interviewed a person who demonstrated sending a message using Google Talkback. This created my interested in Accessibility.

In 2015, I started learning Android and making Android apps. I was fascinated with idea of making something which people can interact with on their phones. Since then, I improved my skills in developing native Android applications, building custom user interfaces, and leveraging the latest technologies to create seamless user experiences.

In 2017, I worked work on security in Android. In 2019, I went a little deeper in terms of security. I believe that it is essential to build systems that protect users' data and privacy. 

In 2018, I got an opportunity to work on accessibility in Android. This was the first time I understood the impact technology can make on people's live. That is when I got my goal statement too. Since then, I have been constantly working on accessibility.

I am also interested in applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. I have experience working with popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn and have developed models for tasks such as product recommendation, image recognition, and natural language processing.

In 2022, I started working on sustainability in Berlin, Germany. Although, I am very new to sustainability at present. But, I am quickly learning about it.
