		<p class="light-gray-color big-intro-heading">Privacy Policy</p>
		<p class="light-gray-color small-intro-para">This Privacy Policy explains how personal data might be collected from users of Contacts - from now on referred to as the app - how they are stored, processed and used by the app.</p>
		<p class="light-gray-color small-intro-para">1. Your Provided Data</p>
		<p class="light-gray-color small-intro-para">As a Contacts user, one may optionally allow the app to read your contacts and make phone calls. Once provided, your contacts will be used by the app for the sole purpose of making phone calls when you explicitly opt for that. This data is not retained or maintained outside the device and it remains there until you explicitly remove it via device's settings, or when you uninstall the app.</p>
		<p class="light-gray-color small-intro-para">2. Required Permissions</p>
		<p class="light-gray-color small-intro-para">The application asks for the permissions for reading contacts, writing contacts, and making a phone call. The permission allows app to list down your contacts in the app and make phone calls using the app. The app does not attempt to manipulate any data in your device.</p>
		<p class="light-gray-color small-intro-para">3. Collection of anonymous data for analytics</p>
		<p class="light-gray-color small-intro-para">While you are interacting with the app, anonymous information regarding your device might be collected for the purpose of crash reporting and usage monitoring related to the app. The information collected helps identify app defects and popular features, that would serve as guidelines for the app's future improvements. Only that Analytics data which Android platform allows without any extra permission is collected from the app. This data is not shared with any third party service except the ones that the app relies on for data collection.</p>
